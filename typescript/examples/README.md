# Introduction

reality-capture-examples contains some examples for reality-capture.

It has been tested with Node 16.17.0 and should work with Node 16.17.0 and newer.

## Pre-reqs

To build and run the source code locally you will need a few things:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16 (must be greater than 16.17.x).
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Build and run the examples

- Clone the repository

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/iTwin/reality-capture
  ```

- Since this repo has a (temporary) local dependency on typescript/sdk and typescript/sdk-node, 
  this project has to be build. See [sdk](./../sdk/README.md) and [sdk-node](./../sdk-node/README.md) for more information.

- Install dependencies

  ```sh
  cd reality-capture/typescript/examples
  npm install
  ```
- If npm install doesn't work with node v16 and newer

  ```sh
  npm install --legacy-peer-deps
  ```

- Create a new `.env` file, based on `template.env`. Fill in the required fields in the `.env` configuration file.

- Then, replace the input data paths with yours. You can download data samples here : [data](https://communities.bentley.com/products/3d_imaging_and_point_cloud_software/w/wiki/54656/context-insights-detectors-download-page)
- Replace qa/dev environment with the one you want to use.

  npm run build
  ```
