## Description

The **@itwin/reality-capture-analysis** package contains a sdk to send requests to the Reality Analysis API, part of the iTwin platform.

iTwin.js is an open source platform for creating, querying, modifying, and displaying Infrastructure Digital Twins. To learn more about the iTwin Platform and its APIs, visit the iTwin developer portal.

## Documentation

For more information about Reality Analysis package, see [Reality Analysis APi documentation](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/realitydataanalysis/)

## Requirements

A registered application in the iTwin Platform is needed for using the Reality Analysis Service. Documentation for registering an application can be found [here.](https://developer.bentley.com/tutorials/register-and-modify-application/) Make sure that your application has `realitydataanalysis:read realitydataanalysis:modify` scopes enabled. 

To use the Reality Analysis API you will need to have an access to a project. If you don't have one already, contact one of your Organization Administrators or take some time to go through the following tutorial: Create a [Project](https://developer.bentley.com/tutorials/create-and-query-projects-guide).

To build and run the Reality Analysis service, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v18 (must be greater than 18.12.x).

## Key Types and Methods

- `submitJob` : submit the given job
- `cancelJob` : cancel the given job
- `deleteJob` : delete the given job
- `getJobProgress` : get the progress of the given job
- `getJobProperties` : get the properties of the given job, such as the settings, the creation date etc...
- `getJobEstimatedCost` : get the estimation cost

### RDASJobType
