## Key Types and Methods

### defaultProgressHook

Sample progress hook for upload and download

### RealityDataTransferBrowser

- `setUploadHook` : Set the upload progress hook
- `setDownloadHook` : Set the download progress hook
- `getScopes` : get the required scopes to use this client.
- `downloadRealityDataBrowser` : download reality data from ProjectWise ContextShare
- `uploadRealityDataBrowser` : upload reality data to ProjectWise ContextShare

### ReferenceTableBrowser

Stores the local path and cloud id of each uploaded data. When uploading a new reality data such as context scene, it might contains local paths, which doesn't mean anything in the cloud. The reference table will check for any local path in the context scene and replace it with the corresponding cloud id.

- `save` : open a file picker and save references as txt file
- `load` : load references from selected file. Open a file picker to select the reference file
- `addReference` : add a new entry in the reference table
- `removeReference` : remove entry from the reference table
- `hasLocalPath` : check if the provided local path exists in the reference table
- `hasCloudId` : check if the provided cloud id exists in the reference table
- `getCloudIdFromLocalPath` : get a reality data id from a local path
- `getLocalPathFromCloudId` : get a local path from a reality data id
