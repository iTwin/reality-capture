# Examples

To run an example file you will need to change the `config.py` file: `client_id` should be the id of your application and `project_id` the id of your ProjectWise project. To retrieve the id of your project, click on the `ContextShare` button bellow the name of your project at [CONNECT Center](https://connect.bentley.com/) and copy the **contextId** string on the address bar. Don't forget to also change the **secret** variable if your application has one.

You will also need to change the variables at the beginning of the example file youâ€™re running so that they reflect the files you want to use and where you want to save the results. You can download the detectors available as well as example datasets [here](https://communities.bentley.com/products/3d_imaging_and_point_cloud_software/w/wiki/54656/context-insights-detectors-download-page). Don't forget to first open context scene files with a text editor and replace the reference paths to the path of the images in your machine so that they point to the local path where you saved the images.
